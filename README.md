# My Atmosphere-Example-Projects

As a developer and a user of Anaren Atmosphere, I have some example projects that are 
a little bit outside the norm of the supported examples and demos found on the Atmosphere 
Wiki and in the Atmospher public demos github repo. 

Just a note - these may be experimental and unsupported by Official Atmosphere so don't 
ask questions about why my demos may or may not work!

But by all means feel free to play around with some of the things I'm doing in here, that
leverage more power of the Atmosphere IDE.
